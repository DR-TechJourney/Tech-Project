<p style="font-family:calibri;font-size:18px; text-align:center;">
Today marks the start of something exciting!<br>  
I’ve officially embarked on my journey into the world of web development.<br>  
My goal? To expand my tech skills and transition <br>  
from logistics to a dynamic, tech-driven career.</p>

<p style="font-family:calibri;font-size:18px; text-align:center;">
I figured the best way to learn and stay motivated was to document my progress.<br>  
So here we are—an open, evolving space where I’ll share everything I discover.<br>  
If you’re someone who’s curious about coding or thinking about a career switch,<br>  
let’s take this leap together. Who knows? This might be the start of something big.</p>  

<!-- Description -->
<h2 style="text-align:center;">My Home Lab</h2>
<p style="font-family:calibri;font-size:18px; text-align:center;">
Since I’m starting from scratch, I’ve been diving into tutorials <br>  
that will serve as my foundation. <br>  
Check out one of the best beginner-friendly resources below and follow along!<br>  
To get started, all you need is a computer with internet access, a pen, and some paper.<br>  
Old-school note-taking is underrated, trust me! </p>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp" style="display: block; text-align: center;">Check out the tutorial here!</a>

<p style="font-family:calibri;font-size:18px; text-align:center;">
The mission is simple: master the basics of HTML while keeping things budget-friendly.<br>  
Now, a little about me—I've spent over a decade in the logistics industry.<br>  
It’s been a solid career, but I’ve realized that I crave something different.<br>  
Something more creative, more challenging—something that truly sparks my curiosity.<br>  
That’s why I’m diving headfirst into the world of tech, ready to embrace the unknown!</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Why Now?</h2>
<p style="font-family:calibri;font-size:18px; text-align:center;">
So, why the sudden shift?<br>  
Because I know my mind is capable of more, and I want to push its limits.<br>  
I want to build, innovate, and contribute to something meaningful.<br>  
This is my chance to take a bold leap of faith—out of my comfort zone and into tech.<br>  
No more waiting for the ‘perfect time.’ The time is now!</p>

<p style="font-family:calibri;font-size:18px; text-align:center;">
